  Hi, my name is Misty Exter.
  <br>
  I'm a student at The Flatiron School.
  <p>
  I've been a student at The Flatiron School for 1 day. Programming has always been an ambition of mine but since I had so many other passions, it got lost in the mix, only to surface now, in my mid-30s. I also really dig Archaeology. One day I hope to be able to find new innovative ways to facilitate interdisciplanary information communication standards and better environmental imaging techniques, so that professionals in various connected disciplines can better communicate their ideas, and share information with eachother and the broader community.
